# Red Kaiju Racing: Kimi Buttons
#### PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS AN EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS AND THERE IS LITTLE CODE FOR NOW. MORE WILL BE COMING SOON

RKR Kimi Buttons is an upcoming Android app for Sim Racers to keep track of their button configurations when switching games. Racers will 
also be able to share their configurations with others. When completed, this app will allow the user to take a photo of their racing wheel, 
and attach labels to them for each game saved to keep track of their wheel configs easier for those who play multiple sims such as iRacing
and Assetto Corsa.
